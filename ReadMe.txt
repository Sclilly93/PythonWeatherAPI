The main goal of the weather data retrieval and storage program is to make it easy for users to get the latest weather information for any location. To use the program, users need to enter the city and state they want the weather for, along with their OpenWeatherMap API key. This key is used to fetch the weather data from the API. The program organizes the data from the response and saves it to a CSV file named after the city and state. Users can also find instructions on how to get an API key and exit the program if needed in the program menu. This program was created to provide a useful tool for users to access and save weather data for different purposes, like planning outdoor activities, monitoring weather conditions, or studying past weather patterns for data science.
